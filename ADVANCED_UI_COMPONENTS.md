# Advanced UI Components for DAUNS Extension

## Overview

The DAUNS extension includes several advanced UI components that enhance the developer experience by providing visual feedback, navigation aids, and interactive elements for variable analysis.

## Components

### 1. Variable Hover Provider

Provides detailed information about variables when hovering over them in the editor.

**Features:**

- Displays variable name, type, and declaration information
- Shows scope and value preview (when available)
- Includes usage statistics (number of references)
- Offers quick actions for common operations:
  - Rename variable
  - Find all references
  - Extract variable

**Implementation:**
The hover provider is registered for all file types and uses the variable scanner to extract information about the hovered variable.

### 2. Variable Decoration Provider

Adds visual decorations to variables in the editor to highlight specific characteristics.

**Features:**

- **Unused Variables**: Displayed with a line-through and warning color
- **Shadowed Variables**: Highlighted with an error border
- **Global Variables**: Shown in bold with info color
- Hover messages provide additional context for decorated variables

**Implementation:**
The decoration provider updates whenever the active editor changes or when text documents are modified. It uses VS Code's decoration API to apply visual styles.

### 3. Minimap Provider

Adds indicators to the minimap for quick visual identification of variable declarations and references.

**Features:**

- Shows variable declarations as markers in the minimap
- Displays variable references as additional markers
- Hovering over minimap markers shows variable information

**Implementation:**
The minimap provider uses VS Code's overview ruler decorations to add visual indicators to the minimap. It updates when the active editor changes or when text documents are modified.

### 4. Variable Breadcrumb Provider

Provides hierarchical navigation through variable scopes using VS Code's breadcrumb feature.

**Features:**

- Groups variables by scope (function, block, global, etc.)
- Displays variable types with appropriate symbols
- Allows navigation to specific variables through the breadcrumb bar

**Implementation:**
The breadcrumb provider implements VS Code's DocumentSymbolProvider interface to provide hierarchical symbol information for variables.

### 5. Custom Tree Icons

Enhances the tree view with custom icons that reflect variable types and status.

**Features:**

- Type-specific icons (string, number, boolean, function, object, array, etc.)
- Status indicators:
  - Warning icon for unused variables
  - Globe icon for global variables
- Consistent with VS Code's symbol icons

**Implementation:**
The custom tree icons component maps variable types to appropriate VS Code icons and adds status modifiers based on variable properties.

### 6. Interactive Variable Panel

Provides a webview-based panel with detailed information about variables in a file.

**Features:**

- Displays all variables in a file with detailed information
- Shows variable name, type, scope, and value (when available)
- Clicking on a variable navigates to its declaration in the editor
- Responsive design that matches VS Code's theme

**Implementation:**
The interactive panel uses VS Code's webview API to create a custom panel with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It communicates with the extension through message passing.

## Integration

All UI components are integrated into the extension through the `activate` function in `extension.ts`. Each component is properly registered with VS Code's API and added to the extension's subscriptions for proper cleanup.

## Configuration

The advanced UI components work automatically and don't require additional configuration. However, they respect VS Code's theme settings and will adapt their appearance accordingly.

## Performance

The UI components are designed to be lightweight and efficient:

- Decorations and minimap updates are debounced to prevent excessive processing
- Hover information is calculated on-demand
- Breadcrumb information is cached when possible
- The interactive panel only loads when explicitly requested

## Extensibility

The UI components are designed with extensibility in mind:

- Each component is implemented as a separate class
- Components have minimal dependencies on each other
- Adding new decoration types or hover information is straightforward
- The interactive panel can be easily extended with new features
