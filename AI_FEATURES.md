## AI Variable Analyzer

The AI Variable Analyzer provides intelligent suggestions for variable naming, usage patterns, and potential issues.

### Features

- **Naming Convention Analysis**: Evaluates variable names against industry best practices and provides suggestions for improvement.
- **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Identifies suboptimal variable usage patterns such as unused variables, variables that are only assigned but never read, or variables that could be constants.
- **Scope and Lifetime Analysis**: Analyzes variable scopes and lifetimes to identify potential issues such as variable shadowing or global variables with many references.

## Code Quality Analysis

The Code Quality Analysis feature provides comprehensive metrics and recommendations for improving code quality based on variable usage patterns.

### Features

- **Quality Scores**: Provides scores for various aspects of code quality including naming conventions, usage patterns, and scope management.
- **File Complexity Metrics**: Analyzes file complexity based on factors such as variable count, type diversity, global variable percentage, and cyclomatic complexity.
- **Recommendations**: Generates specific recommendations for improving code quality based on the analysis.

## Security Analysis

The Security Analysis feature identifies potential security vulnerabilities in your code related to variable usage.

### Features

- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Detects when sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.) is potentially exposed through logs, browser storage, or client-side output.
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Identifies hardcoded credentials in your code that should be moved to environment variables or secure credential stores.
- **Unsafe Function Usage**: Detects potentially unsafe function calls such as `eval()`, dynamic Function creation, or setting HTML content with user-provided data.
- **Command Injection**: Identifies potential command injection vulnerabilities when user input is passed to system commands.
- **SQL Injection**: Detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities when user input is used in SQL queries.
- **Prototype Pollution**: Identifies potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities when object prototypes are modified with user input.

## Team Collaboration

The Team Collaboration feature allows you to share variable analysis results with your team members and collaborate on code reviews.

### Features

- **Share Analysis**: Allows saving and sharing variable analysis results with your team.
- **Comments**: Supports adding comments to specific variables for team discussion.
- **Export/Import**: Provides export capabilities for analysis results to various formats (JSON, HTML, Markdown, CSV) and import them back.

## Internationalization (i18n)

The internationalization support includes multiple languages.

### Supported Languages

- English
- Spanish (Español)
- French (Français)
- German (Deutsch)
- Chinese (Simplified) (简体中文)
- Japanese (日本語)
- Korean (한국어)
- Russian (Русский)
- Portuguese (Brazil) (Português (Brasil))
- Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)

## Configuration

You can configure the AI features through VS Code settings:

- `dauns.locale`: Set the language for the extension interface.
- `dauns.aiAnalysisEnabled`: Enable or disable AI-powered variable analysis.
- `dauns.securityAnalysisEnabled`: Enable or disable security vulnerability analysis.
- `dauns.teamCollaborationEnabled`: Enable or disable team collaboration features.
