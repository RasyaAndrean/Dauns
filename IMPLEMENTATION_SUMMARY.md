- **YAML Parser** - Variable-like structure detection in YAML files
- **Parser Factory** - Centralized parser creation and management

**Key Features:**

- Interface-based architecture for extensibility
- Language-specific parsing logic
- Support for imports and references
- Refactoring capability detection

### 2. Advanced UI Components

**Files:** `src/ui/`

- **Cross-Reference Tracking** - Multi-file variable references

**Key Features:**

- Graph-based dependency visualization
- Pattern recognition for unusual behaviors
- Circular dependency detection
- Webview-based analysis displays

### 5. Refactoring Tools

**Files:** `src/refactoring/`

Comprehensive refactoring capabilities:

- **Rename Provider** - Workspace-wide variable renaming
- **Extract Variable Provider** - Code extraction tools
- **Convert Variable Provider** - Declaration conversion tools
- **Inline Variable Provider** - Variable inlining tools
- **Refactoring Commands** - Centralized command management

**Key Features:**

- Safe text replacement
- Preview panels for major operations
- Progress indication with cancellation
- Smart naming suggestions

### 6. Core Functionality

**Files:** `src/extension.ts`, `src/workspaceScanner.ts`, `src/treeViewProvider.ts`

Foundational extension components:

- **Workspace Scanning** - Multi-file variable analysis
- **Tree View Provider** - Hierarchical variable display
- **Configuration Management** - User-customizable settings
- **Unused Variable Detection** - Dead code identification

**Key Features:**

- File-based organization

- `src/test/simplePerformanceTest.ts` - Simple verification tests

## Configuration

The extension supports extensive customization through VS Code settings:

- File extension filtering
- Node modules inclusion/exclusion
- File size limits
- Variable display options
- Custom parsing patterns

## Integration

All components have been integrated into the main extension entry point (`src/extension.ts`) with proper lifecycle management and resource disposal.

## Future Enhancements

The extension has been designed with extensibility in mind, making it easy to add:

- Additional language parsers
- New analysis capabilities
- Enhanced UI components
- Advanced refactoring tools
- Integration with external tools and services

## Technical Implementation

**Technology Stack:**

- TypeScript for type safety and tooling support
- VS Code Extension API for deep editor integration
- ESLint for code quality assurance
- Mocha/Chai for testing

**Architecture Patterns:**

- Modular component design
- Interface-based extensibility
- Event-driven updates
- Performance-oriented implementation

## Conclusion

The DAUNS extension has evolved from a simple variable detection tool into a comprehensive code analysis platform with advanced visualization, performance optimization, and refactoring capabilities. The modular architecture ensures maintainability and extensibility for future enhancements.
