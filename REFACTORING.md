# DAUNS Refactoring Tools

## Overview

DAUNS now includes powerful refactoring tools that help developers improve their code quality through automated transformations. These tools are designed to be safe, efficient, and intuitive to use.

## Refactoring Features

### 1. Rename Variable Across Workspace

#### Purpose

Rename a variable across all files in your workspace with confidence and preview capabilities.

#### How It Works

The rename feature:

1. Scans all JavaScript/TypeScript files in your workspace
2. Identifies all occurrences of the specified variable
3. Shows a preview of affected files
4. Performs the rename operation across all files
5. Provides progress indication and cancellation support

#### Safety Features

- Preview panel showing all affected files before making changes
- Progress indication with cancellation support
- Error handling for individual files
- Atomic operations to prevent partial changes

#### Usage

1. Right-click in any JavaScript/TypeScript file
2. Select "Refactoring" → "Rename Variable Across Workspace"
3. Enter the current variable name
4. Review the preview of affected files
5. Confirm and enter the new variable name
6. The extension will rename the variable across all files

### 2. Extract Variable

#### Purpose

Convert complex expressions or repeated code into named variables for better readability and maintainability.

#### How It Works

The extract variable feature:

1. Takes selected code and converts it into a new variable declaration
2. Places the declaration in an appropriate scope
3. Replaces the selected code with the new variable name
4. Provides intelligent naming suggestions

#### Smart Naming

The smart extract feature analyzes the selected code to suggest appropriate variable names:

- Function calls: `functionNameResult`
- String literals: camelCase version of the string content
- Array literals: `array`
- Object literals: `object`
- Mathematical expressions: `mathResult`
- DOM operations: `element`
- JSON operations: `parsedData` or `jsonString`

#### Usage

1. Select the code you want to extract
2. Right-click → "Refactoring" → "Extract Variable" or "Extract Variable with Smart Naming"
3. Enter or confirm the variable name
4. The extension will create a new variable declaration and replace the selected code

### 3. Convert Variable Declaration

#### Purpose

Change variable declarations between `var`, `let`, and `const` with intelligent recommendations.

#### How It Works

The convert feature:

1. Analyzes the current variable declaration
2. Examines usage patterns to recommend the best declaration type
3. Allows manual selection of declaration type
4. Updates the declaration keyword

#### Smart Recommendations

The smart convert feature analyzes:

- Reassignment patterns (suggests `let` for reassigned variables)
- Single declaration (suggests `const` for never-reassigned variables)
- Multiple declarations (identifies potential issues with `var`)

#### Usage

1. Place cursor on a variable declaration line
2. Right-click → "Refactoring" → "Convert Variable Declaration" or "Convert Variable with Smart Suggestions"
3. Select the new declaration type
4. The extension will update the declaration

### 4. Inline Variable

#### Purpose

Replace variable usages with its value to simplify code when the variable is no longer needed.

#### How It Works

The inline variable feature:

1. Identifies all usages of the variable
2. Replaces each usage with the variable's value
3. Removes the variable declaration
4. Preserves code functionality

#### Safety Features

- Confirmation dialog before making changes
- Detection of unused variables
- Preservation of code semantics

#### Usage

1. Place cursor on a variable declaration line
2. Right-click → "Refactoring" → "Inline Variable"
3. Confirm the inlining operation
4. The extension will replace all usages with the variable's value and remove the declaration

## Technical Implementation

### Refactoring Directory Structure

```
src/refactoring/
├── renameProvider.ts          # Workspace-wide variable renaming
├── extractVariableProvider.ts # Code extraction tools
├── convertVariableProvider.ts # Variable declaration conversion
├── inlineVariableProvider.ts  # Variable inlining tools
└── refactoringCommands.ts     # Command registration and coordination
```

### Key Components

#### RenameProvider ([renameProvider.ts](file:///D:/DAUNS/src/refactoring/renameProvider.ts))

- Workspace-wide file scanning
- Progress indication with cancellation
- Preview panel generation
- Safe text replacement using VS Code's WorkspaceEdit API

#### ExtractVariableProvider ([extractVariableProvider.ts](file:///D:/DAUNS/src/refactoring/extractVariableProvider.ts))

- Scope analysis for optimal declaration placement
- Smart naming algorithm based on expression content
- Text selection and replacement operations

#### ConvertVariableProvider ([convertVariableProvider.ts](file:///D:/DAUNS/src/refactoring/convertVariableProvider.ts))

- Usage pattern analysis for smart recommendations
- Declaration keyword replacement
- Best practice suggestions

#### InlineVariableProvider ([inlineVariableProvider.ts](file:///D:/DAUNS/src/refactoring/inlineVariableProvider.ts))

- Usage detection and replacement
- Declaration removal
- Safety checks and user confirmation

#### RefactoringCommands ([refactoringCommands.ts](file:///D:/DAUNS/src/refactoring/refactoringCommands.ts))

- Command registration with VS Code
- User interaction flow coordination
- Error handling and user feedback

## Performance Considerations

### Large Workspace Handling

- Progress indication for long operations
- Cancellation support for better UX
- Efficient file processing algorithms
- Memory-conscious data handling

### Text Processing

- Precise regex-based text matching
- Safe replacement operations using VS Code APIs
- Minimal memory footprint during operations

## Safety Features

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when individual files fail
- Comprehensive error reporting to users
- Recovery from partial failures

### User Confirmation

- Preview panels for major operations
- Confirmation dialogs for irreversible changes
- Clear feedback on operation results

### Code Integrity

- Atomic operations to prevent partial changes
- Preservation of code semantics
- Validation of variable names and expressions

## Limitations

Current limitations of the refactoring tools:

- Limited to JavaScript and TypeScript
- May not catch all edge cases in complex code structures
- Smart naming suggestions are rule-based rather than AI-powered
- Scope analysis is simplified and may not be completely accurate in all cases

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the refactoring features:

- AI-powered variable naming suggestions
- Support for additional languages
- More sophisticated scope analysis
- Integration with TypeScript's language service
- Advanced refactoring patterns (extract function, etc.)
- Batch refactoring operations
